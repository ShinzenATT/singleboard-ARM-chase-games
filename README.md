#  Graphical games for singleboard ARM computer MD-407

Here are some small games regarding moving a sprite around by using a keypad.
The spider chase game also involves chasing a boucing fly.

To build any of the projects then the ARM gcc & g++ toolchain is needed along with a way to send
the compiled software to your device such as GDB or by cable. Run `make *.mk` to compile and make the program.

There is also documentation about the MD-407 and the components used with it. The MD-407 and some
components are created by chalmers so some of the documentation is in Swedish. The documents can be
found in the `docs` folder.
